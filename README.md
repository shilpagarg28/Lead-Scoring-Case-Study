Identifying the most potential leads using Logistic Regression. Building model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
